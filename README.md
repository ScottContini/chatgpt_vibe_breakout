# Breakout game created by Vibe Coding with ChatGPT

This is a first attempt at creating a game mimicking the classic Breakout by Vibe coding with ChatGPT.  Just open canvas.html with a browser and then you can play
by either using the arrow keys or the mouse.  It's not perfect -- there seems to be sound problems with Firefox, but ChatGPT failed to fix it with only vibe coding.
